# StackPHP
Stack is going to be the world's next greatest web development programming language. ;)

StackPHP is going to contain the tools needed for lexing, parsing, syntactical analysis, optimization, and bytecode generation.

# Performance
## Lexer
The lexer can lex files at a rate of about 1mb/2.9s and performs lexing in O(n).

Memory usage does not change based on the size of the input file and stays about 4.00mb (using PHPUnit for testing this).
